Abstract:
Adopting digital technologies in a business can help with sustainable supply chain management. These technologies can make e-commerce development faster and empower the emergence of B2B e-commerce businesses. In this study, our focus was to develop a framework for an Internet of things (IoT) embedded sustainable supply chain to deliver textile items using a B2B e-commerce business model. We formulated a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to minimize the total supply chain cost, including the B2B orders’ packaging, handling, and transportation, with carbon emission taxation. Furthermore, the purchasing cost of the RFID tags and IoT facilities that were provided on the transport vehicles was high. The proposed model was solved by using the global solver in the LINGO software package and finding the optimized value of the total supply chain network cost. We tested the proposed model in different case scenarios, i.e., small- to significant-sized problems. Then, a sensitivity analysis was performed to observe the variations in the overall cost of the supply chain network when there were changes in the main parameters of the proposed model. The results of the models showed that models can be helpful for efficient logistics planning and supply chain design.

Abstract:
The traditional supply chain system included smart objects to enhance intelligence, automation capabilities, and intelligent decision-making. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are providing unprecedented opportunities to enhance efficiency and reduce the cost of the existing system of the supply chain. This article aims to study the prevailing supply chain system and explore the benefits obtained after smart objects and embedded networks of IoT are implanted. Short-range communication technologies, radio frequency identification (RFID), middleware, and cloud computing are extensively comprehended to conceptualize the smart supply chain management system. Moreover, manufacturers are achieving maximum benefits in terms of safety, cost, intelligent management of inventory, and decision-making. This study also offers concepts of smart carriage, loading/unloading, transportation, warehousing, and packaging for the secure distribution of products. Furthermore, the tracking of customers to convince them to make more purchases and the modification of shops with the assistance of the Internet of Things are thoroughly idealized.
