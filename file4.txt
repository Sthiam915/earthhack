Abstract:
This study is aimed at a succinct review of practical impacts of grid integration of renewable energy systems on effectiveness of power networks, as well as often employed state-of-the-art solution strategies. The renewable energy resources focused on include solar energy, wind energy, biomass energy and geothermal energy, as well as renewable hydrogen/fuel cells, which, although not classified purely as renewable resources, are a famous energy carrier vital for future energy sustainability. Although several world energy outlooks have suggested that the renewable resources available worldwide are sufficient to satisfy global energy needs in multiples of thousands, the different challenges often associated with practical exploitation have made this assertion an illusion to date. Thus, more research efforts are required to synthesize the nature of these challenges as well as viable solution strategies, hence, the need for this review study. First, brief overviews are provided for each of the studied renewable energy sources. Next, challenges and solution strategies associated with each of them at generation phase are discussed, with reference to power grid integration. Thereafter, challenges and common solution strategies at the grid/electrical interface are discussed for each of the renewable resources. Finally, expert opinions are provided, comprising a number of aphorisms deducible from the review study, which reveal knowledge gaps in the field and potential roadmap for future research. In particular, these opinions include the essential roles that renewable hydrogen will play in future energy systems; the need for multi-sectoral coupling, specifically by promoting electric vehicle usage and integration with renewable-based power grids; the need for cheaper energy storage devices, attainable possibly by using abandoned electric vehicle batteries for electrical storage, and by further development of advanced thermal energy storage systems (overviews of state-of-the-art thermal and electrochemical energy storage are also provided); amongst others.
